<h1>Literate Erlang</h1>

Literate   Erlang  is    a system    for    writing
<i>literate</i> Erlang programs. In a literate Erlang program the code
is  presented in an  order which best  aids understanding the program
and not in  the order which  the code has  to  be presented to  the
Erlang compiler.<p>

<b>eweb</b> is a program which expands a literate Erlang
program. Literate Erlang programs are stored  in files with a <b>.lit</b>
extension. 

<h1>Installing Literate Erlang</h1>
<hr>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0>

<td valign=top><b>Installing</b></td>
<td>&nbsp</td>
<td valign=top> 
Create a directory where you will store the
<b>eweb</b> program. Fetch the files <b>eweb.erl</b>
and
<b>eweb.lit</b> and store them in this directory.
<p>Compile <b>eweb.erl</b> with your favorite Erlang.
<p>evaluate the expression <b>eweb:file("eweb").</b>
<p>Evaluating this expression will cause a number of files to be
created <b>eweb.tex</b>, <b>Makefile</b>, <b>eweb</b> etc.

<p>Give the command <b>Make doc</b> to make the documentation.
This will create the file <b>eweb.dvi</b>.

<p><b>Note:</b> for this to work you must have installed LaTeX
on your machine. It is assumed that you have already done this :-)

<td valign=top><b>Running</b></td>   
<td>&nbsp</td> 

    <td valign=top>If you look in the installation directory you will
find  a script  called <b>eweb</b>. Edit  the path  in  this script to
point to the installation directory and put this  file somewhere in you
path.

    <p> The command <b>eweb</b> scans the  current directory and looks
for any  <b>.lit</b>  files which have  a later  date  stamp  that the
corresponding <b>.tex</b> files. It then runs <b>eweb:file</b> on any
such files.
